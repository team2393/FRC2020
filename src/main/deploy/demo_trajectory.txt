# Demo trajectory
# Start position is X 0, Y 0, Heading 0,
# i.e. "looking up the X axis"

# Reverse

# Point on the way, absolute X, Y
#Point 3 0

# Just "P" can also be used for "Point"
#P 3 -1

# Relative point on the way, X, Y relative to last point
#RPoint 0 -1

# End position X Y Heading
End 0.5 0 0
